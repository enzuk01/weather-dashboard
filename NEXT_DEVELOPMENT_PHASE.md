# Weather Dashboard: Next Development Phase

## Release v1.4.0 Completed

We have successfully completed the v1.4.0 release with the following major improvements:

1. **Server Script Refactoring**
   - Moved all scripts to dedicated `scripts/` directory
   - Created centralized utility functions in `server-utils.sh`
   - Added symbolic links for backward compatibility
   - Created comprehensive server management documentation

2. **Backend Improvements**
   - Fixed wind chill calculation in weather service
   - Enhanced error handling in API endpoints
   - Improved server startup reliability

3. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Created `SERVER_MANAGEMENT.md` with detailed usage instructions
   - Updated README with new script organization
   - Fixed test case for wind chill calculation

## Priorities for Next Development Phase

Based on the roadmap in WEATHER_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md, the next development phase will focus on:

### 1. Weather Map Optimization

- [ ] Implement efficient grid-based visualization
- [ ] Optimize data point density calculations
- [ ] Improve weather data fetching strategy
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between data points

### 2. Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Complete unit tests for core components
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation

### 3. Internationalization

- [ ] Set up i18n infrastructure
- [ ] Create initial language packs (English, Spanish, French)
- [ ] Add language selection UI
- [ ] Implement text direction support for RTL languages

### 4. Performance Enhancements

- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Add progressive loading for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize map rendering performance
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard

## Development Approach

1. **Feature Branches**
   - Create a dedicated branch for each feature area
   - Use conventional commit messages
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage

2. **Weekly Milestones**
   - Week 1: Weather map optimization
   - Week 2: Test coverage and documentation
   - Week 3: Internationalization framework
   - Week 4: Performance optimization

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - All new features must include corresponding tests
   - Use real API response fixtures for test data
   - Maintain end-to-end tests for critical paths

## Getting Started

To begin work on the next development phase:

1. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard
   ./server-restart.sh
   ```

3. **Development Tools**
   - Use `SERVER_MANAGEMENT.md` for server management guidance
   - Follow the testing strategy in WEATHER_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md
   - Refer to existing code patterns for consistency

## Definition of Done

Each feature is considered complete when:

1. All acceptance criteria are met
2. Tests are passing with adequate coverage
3. Documentation is updated
4. Code passes linting and formatting checks
5. The feature has been reviewed and approved
6. The feature branch has been merged to main

## Release Planning

The target release date for v1.5.0 is four weeks from now, focusing on the weather map optimization and internationalization features.

Next, v1.6.0 will integrate the performance enhancements and complete the testing infrastructure.
