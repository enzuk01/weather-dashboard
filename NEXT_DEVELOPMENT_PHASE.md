# Weather Dashboard: Next Development Phase

## Current Progress

We have successfully implemented the following features:

1. **Server Script Refactoring** (v1.4.0)
   - Moved all scripts to dedicated `scripts/` directory
   - Created centralized utility functions in `server-utils.sh`
   - Added symbolic links for backward compatibility
   - Created comprehensive server management documentation

2. **Backend Improvements** (v1.4.0)
   - Fixed wind chill calculation in weather service
   - Enhanced error handling in API endpoints
   - Improved server startup reliability

3. **Documentation and Testing** (v1.4.0)
   - Created `SERVER_MANAGEMENT.md` with detailed usage instructions
   - Updated README with new script organization
   - Fixed test case for wind chill calculation

4. **UI Reorganization** (Unreleased)
   - Implemented tabbed interface for organizing dashboard components
   - Created three main tabs: "24 Hours", "7 Days", and "Historical"
   - Added placeholder for upcoming historical data visualization
   - Improved user experience with cleaner layout

## Priorities for Next Development Phase

Based on the roadmap and recent UI changes, the next development phase will focus on:

### 1. Historical Weather Data Implementation

- [ ] Design historical weather data API
- [ ] Create historical data fetching service
- [ ] Implement historical comparison visualization
- [ ] Complete UI for the "Historical" tab
- [ ] Add date range selection for historical data

### 2. Weather Map Optimization

- [ ] Implement efficient grid-based visualization
- [ ] Optimize data point density calculations
- [ ] Improve weather data fetching strategy
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between data points

### 3. Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Complete unit tests for core components
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation

### 4. Internationalization

- [ ] Set up i18n infrastructure
- [ ] Create initial language packs (English, Spanish, French)
- [ ] Add language selection UI
- [ ] Implement text direction support for RTL languages

### 5. Performance Enhancements

- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Add progressive loading for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize map rendering performance
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard

## Development Approach

1. **Feature Branches**
   - Create a dedicated branch for each feature area
   - Use conventional commit messages
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage

2. **Weekly Milestones**
   - Week 1: Historical weather data implementation
   - Week 2: Weather map optimization
   - Week 3: Test coverage and documentation
   - Week 4: Internationalization framework
   - Week 5: Performance optimization

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - All new features must include corresponding tests
   - Use real API response fixtures for test data
   - Maintain end-to-end tests for critical paths

## Getting Started

To begin work on the next development phase:

1. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard
   ./server-restart.sh
   ```

3. **Development Tools**
   - Use `SERVER_MANAGEMENT.md` for server management guidance
   - Follow the testing strategy in WEATHER_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md
   - Refer to existing code patterns for consistency

## Definition of Done

Each feature is considered complete when:

1. All acceptance criteria are met
2. Tests are passing with adequate coverage
3. Documentation is updated
4. Code passes linting and formatting checks
5. The feature has been reviewed and approved
6. The feature branch has been merged to main

## Release Planning

The target release date for v1.5.0 is five weeks from now, focusing on the historical data visualization and weather map optimization.

Next, v1.6.0 will integrate the internationalization features and performance enhancements.
