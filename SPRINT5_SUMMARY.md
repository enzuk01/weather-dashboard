# Sprint 5 Summary

## Major Accomplishments

### Backend Improvements

1. **Fixed API Integration Issues**
   - Replaced the unreliable optimized OpenMeteo client with a stable basic implementation
   - Resolved CurrentUnits/HourlyUnits errors in the weather service
   - Ensured consistent API responses for both current weather and hourly forecast endpoints

2. **Added Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created unit tests for the weather service module, particularly the feels-like temperature calculation
   - Implemented integration tests for the favorites API endpoints
   - Added a test runner script for easily executing all backend tests

### Frontend Improvements

1. **Fixed TypeScript Issues**
   - Created missing components (WeatherIcon and WindDirectionIndicator)
   - Fixed type errors in existing components like ErrorState
   - Made interfaces more consistent across the application
   - Updated mockWeatherService to match the updated interfaces

2. **Added Component Tests**
   - Implemented unit tests for the WeatherIcon component
   - Implemented unit tests for the WindDirectionIndicator component
   - Added proper test mocks for dependencies

### Bug Fixes

1. **Interface Consistency**
   - Ensured all components use the correct property names
   - Fixed WeatherCondition type to be consistent throughout the application
   - Updated weather color utilities to work with the updated types

2. **Data Handling**
   - Added relative_humidity_2m and feels_like_temperature to all data interfaces
   - Made mockWeatherService match the real API implementation
   - Updated API clients to handle the new data fields

## Remaining Tasks for Next Sprint

1. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add more robust error handling in the backend
   - Implement a better error handling system in the frontend
   - Add retry mechanisms for API failures

2. **New Features**
   - Implement offline mode using local storage
   - Add UI customization options
   - Create the "Share Weather" feature

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement API request caching
   - Add rate limiting to protect the backend
   - Optimize frontend rendering

## Getting Started

To run the updated application:

1. **Backend**

   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard/backend
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard/frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Tests**

   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd weather-dashboard/backend
   python3 run_tests.py

   # Frontend tests
   cd weather-dashboard/frontend
   npm test
   ```

## Known Issues

- Some TypeScript errors still exist in the frontend tests
- npm directory structure needs to be fixed for proper command execution
- API integration tests require a running backend server
