## Weather Dashboard: Next Development Phase

### Current Development Priorities

1. **Weather Map Optimization**
   - Improve performance of weather map rendering
   - Add ability to toggle different data layers
   - Optimize for mobile devices

2. **Component Performance and Stability**
   - Implement error boundaries for all main components
   - Optimize rendering with memo and useCallback hooks
   - Prevent unnecessary re-renders with proper component structure
   - Add fallback UI for error states

3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for tab switching and data flow
   - Snapshot tests for UI consistency
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

4. **Internationalization**
   - Add language selection options
   - Implement translations for major languages
   - Support region-specific date and unit formats

5. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Cache API responses to reduce server load
   - Implement progressive loading for weather data
   - Add service worker for offline capabilities
   - Optimize bundle size with code splitting

### Completed Tasks

- Implemented new tabbed interface for weather sections
- Added ErrorBoundary component for graceful error handling
- Created test plan and initial unit tests
- Optimized WeatherTabs component with memo and useCallback

### Testing Approach

We've established a testing framework with:

- Jest for unit and component testing
- Run scripts for test automation (`scripts/run-ui-tests.sh`)
- Test results collection and reporting

### Upcoming Tasks

- Add snapshot tests for UI components
- Implement Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Set up continuous integration with automated test runs

## Priority 1 Issues (Critical)

### 1. Modern Daylight Visualization Scrolling Fix

- **Issue Description**: The Modern Daylight Visualization component doesn't scroll in sync with the hourly forecast cards
- **Target Date**: Immediate (Next Sprint)
- **Solution Options**:
  - Complete redesign of the scroll interaction between components
  - Share scroll container and state between components
  - Implement a common scroll controller
  - Consider using IntersectionObserver to track visible elements
- **Testing Plan**: Create automated tests to verify scrolling sync across different browsers and screen sizes

### 2. Resource Monitoring and Optimization

- **Issue Description**: Identify and address potential memory leaks and excessive CPU usage
- **Target Date**: Next 2 Weeks
- **Solution Options**:
  - Implement resource usage throttling
  - Create enhanced monitoring tools
  - Optimize heavy components

## Feature Enhancements

### 1. Extended Forecast Options

- Add 10-day forecast view
- Include more detailed precipitation data
- Enhance chart visualizations

### 2. Weather Alerts System

- Create notification system for severe weather
- Allow user configuration of alert thresholds
- Integrate with local weather alert systems where available

### 3. Location Services Improvements

- Add reverse geocoding for more accurate location names
- Implement address search with autocomplete
- Save and categorize favorite locations

## Technical Debt

### 1. Test Coverage Expansion

- Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
- Add integration tests for key user flows
- Implement visual regression testing

### 2. Code Refactoring

- Split large components into smaller, focused ones
- Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Optimize render performance with memoization

### 3. Documentation Improvement

- Complete API documentation
- Create developer guides
- Add comprehensive comments to complex code sections

## Timeline

- **Sprint 1**: Address P1 issues (Visualization scrolling and initial resource optimization)
- **Sprint 2**: Begin feature enhancements (Extended forecast & alerts system)
- **Sprint 3**: Complete feature enhancements and begin technical debt reduction
- **Sprint 4**: Finalize technical debt reduction and documentation

## Evaluation Metrics

- Performance benchmarks (target: 90+ Lighthouse score)
- Memory usage (target: <100MB across all browsers)
- User session duration (target: 20% increase)
- Error rate (target: <1% of all interactions)
