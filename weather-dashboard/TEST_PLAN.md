### 4. Performance Tests

- [ ] Test code splitting improves initial load time
- [ ] Test optimized logger initialization reduces startup delay
- [ ] Test aggressive caching strategy reduces perceived load times
- [ ] Test parallel data fetching improves overall performance
- [ ] Test background data refreshing doesn't impact UI responsiveness

### 5. Error Recovery Tests

- [ ] Test behavior when API requests fail

- [ ] Test fallback UI display
- [ ] Test error handling in parallel data fetching

## Test Cases

### Tab Switching

1. **Default Tab Selection**
   - Verify that "24 Hours" tab is selected by default
   - Verify tab styling indicates active tab
   - Verify correct content is displayed

2. **Tab Navigation**
   - Click each tab and verify content changes appropriately
   - Verify multiple rapid tab changes don't cause issues
   - Verify tab state persists after page reload

### Feature Flags System

1. **UI Options Panel**
   - Verify UI Options button appears in header
   - Verify panel opens when button is clicked
   - Verify panel displays toggle switches for each feature flag
   - Verify toggle switches reflect current feature flag state

2. **Feature Toggle Functionality**
   - Toggle each feature flag and verify corresponding UI changes
   - Verify "Toggle All" button works correctly
   - Verify "Reset to Default" button resets all flags to their default state
   - Verify changes persist after page reload

3. **Enhanced UI Components**
   - Verify enhanced components appear when corresponding flags are enabled
   - Verify original components appear when flags are disabled
   - Verify transition between components is smooth

### Data Loading Tests

1. **Component Data Loading**
   - Verify that switching tabs doesn't trigger unnecessary data reloading
   - Verify data loading states appear correctly when a tab is first opened
   - Verify data persistence across tab switches

2. **API Error Handling**
   - Mock API errors and verify error states display in each tab
   - Verify retry functionality works in error states
   - Verify partial data display when only some endpoints fail

### Performance Tests

1. **Initial Load Performance**
   - Measure time to interactive with and without code splitting
   - Verify skeleton placeholders appear during lazy loading
   - Test performance on low-end devices

2. **Data Fetching Strategy**
   - Verify cached data is shown immediately while fresh data loads
   - Verify background fetching doesn't block UI interactions
   - Test parallel data loading improves perceived performance

### Cross-Component Tests

1. **Location Change Propagation**
   - Change location and verify all tabs update with new data
   - Verify consistent location display across tabs
   - Verify location data persists when switching tabs

2. **Settings Changes**
   - Change temperature units and verify changes apply across all tabs
   - Change other units and verify consistency
   - Test dark/light mode toggle affects all tabs consistently

## Test Execution Checklist

### 24 Hours Tab

- [ ] Verify all components render correctly
- [ ] Test hourly forecast cards display correct data
- [ ] Test precipitation chart shows correct data
- [ ] Test wind direction chart functions properly
- [ ] Test weather map loads and displays correctly

### 7 Days Tab

- [ ] Verify daily forecast cards display all 7 days
- [ ] Test temperature range is displayed correctly
- [ ] Test weather icon display for each day
- [ ] Test precipitation probability display

### Historical Tab

- [ ] Verify placeholder displays correctly
- [ ] Test responsive behavior of the placeholder
- [ ] Verify styling consistency with other tabs

### Feature Flags System

- [ ] Verify UI Options button is visible in header
- [ ] Test opening and closing the panel
- [ ] Test each feature flag toggle
- [ ] Test "Toggle All" and "Reset to Default" buttons
- [ ] Verify changes persist after page reload
- [ ] Test enhanced components render correctly when enabled

## Known Issues

1. Backend Error:
   - AttributeError: 'OpenMeteoClient' object has no attribute 'format_daily_forecast'
   - Status: Fixed by importing and using the standalone format_daily_forecast function

2. Component Rendering Issues:
   - Components may not properly handle being conditionally rendered in tabs
   - Potential Memory Leaks: Check if components are properly cleaned up when tabs are switched

3. Logger Initialization:
   - Logger initialization may cause delays during application startup
   - Status: Fixed by implementing synchronous initialization

## Test Environment Setup

To run these tests consistently:

1. Start the backend and frontend servers:

   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard
   ./server-restart.sh
   ```

2. Run automated tests:

   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard/frontend
   npm test
   ```

3. Perform manual testing on <http://localhost:3000>

## Reporting Issues

For any issues found during testing, please include:

1. Which tab was active when the issue occurred
2. Which feature flags were enabled/disabled
3. Steps to reproduce the issue
4. Expected vs. actual behavior
5. Browser console errors (if any)
6. Network request failures (if any)

## Future Test Improvements

1. Implement Cypress end-to-end tests for tab navigation and feature flags
2. Add Jest snapshot tests for component rendering states
3. Create automation for visual regression testing
4. Implement performance metrics tracking
5. Add tests for parallel data fetching and background refresh
