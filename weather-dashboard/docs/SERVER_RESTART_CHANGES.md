# Server Restart Improvements

## Overview

Based on our testing and analysis of the Weather Dashboard application restart process, we have implemented several critical improvements to enhance reliability and robustness. This document summarizes the changes made and their expected benefits.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. New server-restart.sh Script

**Problem:** Previous server management approaches had various limitations including unreliable process tracking, lack of selective restart options, and insufficient status feedback.

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive new server-restart.sh script with several key features:

```bash
# Server restart with proper process tracking and status reporting
./server-restart.sh
```

**Key Features:**

- Color-coded status reporting for clear visual feedback
- Selective restart options (backend, frontend, or both)
- Process verification with timeout handling
- Port and pattern-based process termination for reliable cleanup
- Health verification to ensure servers start correctly
- Comprehensive logging to separate log files

**Benefits:**

- Significantly improved reliability for server management
- Better user experience with clear, informative feedback
- More flexibility with selective restart options
- Enhanced troubleshooting with detailed logs

### 2. Process Management Improvements

**Problem:** Unreliable process tracking and termination caused issues with server restarts.

**Solution:** Implemented more robust process management using both port and pattern matching:

```bash
# Kill processes based on both port and pattern
kill_port_process() {
  local port=$1
  local pids

  print_message "Killing any process on port $port..."

  # Get PIDs using lsof
  pids=$(lsof -ti:$port 2>/dev/null)

  if [ -n "$pids" ]; then
    echo "Killing PIDs: $pids"
    kill -9 $pids 2>/dev/null || true
    print_success "Process(es) on port $port terminated"
  else
    print_message "No process found on port $port"
  fi
}

# Kill processes by pattern
kill_by_pattern() {
  local pattern=$1

  print_message "Killing processes matching pattern: $pattern"

  # Use pkill for pattern matching
  pkill -f "$pattern" 2>/dev/null || true

  print_message "Pattern-matching processes terminated"
}
```

**Benefits:**

- More reliable process termination
- Prevents orphaned processes
- Ensures clean state before starting servers

### 3. Server Health Verification

**Problem:** Inadequate health verification could result in servers appearing to start but not functioning properly.

**Solution:** Implemented timeout-based health verification with proper checks:

```bash
# Wait for backend to start with timeout
local start_time=$(date +%s)
local timeout=15  # 15 seconds timeout

while true; do
  sleep 1
  if lsof -ti:$BACKEND_PORT >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    print_success "Backend server is running on port $BACKEND_PORT with PID $BACKEND_PID"
    break
  fi

  local current_time=$(date +%s)
  local elapsed=$((current_time - start_time))

  if [ $elapsed -ge $timeout ]; then
    print_error "Timed out waiting for backend server to start"
    print_warning "Check logs at $LOGS_DIR/backend.log for details"
    return 1
  fi

  echo -n "."
done
```

**Benefits:**

- Ensures servers are fully operational before reporting success
- Provides clear feedback on startup progress
- Handles timeout conditions gracefully with informative messages

### 4. Improved Logging

**Problem:** Scattered and inconsistent log files made troubleshooting difficult.

**Solution:** Implemented dedicated log files for each server:

```bash
# Backend logging
../venv/bin/python app.py --no-debug > "$LOGS_DIR/backend.log" 2>&1 &

# Frontend logging
npm start > "$LOGS_DIR/frontend.log" 2>&1 &
```

**Benefits:**

- Easier troubleshooting with server-specific logs
- Better organization of log information
- Improved error tracking and diagnosis

## Documentation Updates

- Updated SERVER_MANAGEMENT.md with server-restart.sh usage instructions
- Updated RESTART_TEST_PLAN.md to use server-restart.sh for testing
- Updated README.md to recommend server-restart.sh as the primary server management tool
- Updated RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md to include server-restart.sh in the release testing process

## Conclusion

The implementation of server-restart.sh and associated improvements provides a significant enhancement to the server management process for the Weather Dashboard application. These changes improve reliability, user experience, and maintainability, making the application more robust in various environments.
