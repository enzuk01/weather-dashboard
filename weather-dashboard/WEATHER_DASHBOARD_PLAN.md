## Server Management Improvements

- [x] Implement process management tools (e.g., `pm2` for Node.js, `supervisor` for Python) for automatic server restarts and monitoring.
- [x] Enhance port management to ensure no unnecessary servers are left running.
- [x] Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for both frontend and backend servers.
- [x] Add health check endpoints to the backend for frontend validation.
- [x] Ensure graceful shutdown of servers to clean up resources.
- [x] Use environment variables for server configuration.
- [x] Run automated tests to validate server functionality.
- [x] Update documentation with server management instructions.
- [x] Implement syntax validation for backend server files before startup
- [x] Add robust error reporting for server startup failures

## Preferred Server Management Solution

The `server-restart.sh` script is now the recommended way to start and manage the weather dashboard servers:

```bash
# From the project root directory
./server-restart.sh
```

This script:

- Automatically terminates any existing processes on the required ports
- Starts both frontend and backend servers with proper environment variables
- Implements health checks to verify successful startup
- Provides comprehensive logging to dedicated log files
- Ensures graceful shutdown when terminated
- Detects and reports syntax errors in server files before attempting startup
- Provides detailed error messages for server failures

**IMPORTANT:** Always use this script instead of manually starting servers to prevent port conflicts and ensure consistent behavior after server restarts.

### Completed Server Management Improvements

1. **Direct Server Management (`server-restart.sh`)**
   - Auto-kill existing processes and prevent port conflicts
   - Enhanced process monitoring and auto-restart
   - Proper logging to files for troubleshooting
   - Graceful cleanup on shutdown

2. **PM2-based Process Management**
   - Configuration via `ecosystem.config.js`
   - Auto-restart capabilities with exponential backoff
   - Logging and monitoring integration
   - Persistence across system reboots

3. **Health Check Endpoints**
   - Added `/api/health` endpoint to backend
   - Implemented status checks in startup scripts
   - Created reliable URL availability verification

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Standardized environment variables between scripts
   - Added TypeScript error suppression for development
   - Configured proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests

5. **API Configuration**
   - Fixed import/export naming consistency issues
   - Corrected API endpoint URL construction
   - Updated buildApiUrl function to use correct object references
   - Ensured proper frontend-backend connectivity

## Priority Issues

1. **[CRITICAL] Fix visualization scrolling synchronization**
   - Resolve the issue where the ModernDaylightVisualization doesn't scroll in sync with the HourlyForecast component
   - Consider redesigning the interaction between these components
   - Ensure smooth, synchronized scrolling behavior across all browsers
   - Update component lifecycle to better handle scroll events

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement resource monitoring
   - Set up test environments to detect memory leaks
   - Optimize rendering cycles

3. **Cache Management**
   - Implement improved cache invalidation strategies
   - Add cache versioning

## Recent Improvements

- Implemented rate limiting (max 10 requests per 5 seconds)
- Enhanced caching with TTL (5 min for current, 15 min for hourly data)
- Added error handling for resource issues
- Debounced API fetch methods

### Performance

- Implemented synchronous logging to reduce overhead
- Added memory caching for localStorage to minimize I/O operations
