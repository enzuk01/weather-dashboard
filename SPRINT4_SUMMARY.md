# Sprint 4 Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. "Feels Like" Temperature

We have implemented a comprehensive "Feels Like" temperature feature:

- **Backend Implementation**:
  - Created the `calculate_feels_like_temperature()` function in `weather_service.py` that uses actual temperature, humidity, and wind speed to calculate the apparent temperature
  - The calculation uses appropriate formulas for different temperature ranges (wind chill for cold, heat index for hot)
  - Added the feels_like_temperature to both current weather and hourly forecast API responses

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Updated the `CurrentWeatherDisplay` component to show the "Feels Like" temperature
  - Updated the `HourlyForecastCards` component to display the "Feels Like" temperature below the actual temperature
  - Updated TypeScript interfaces to include the new field

### 2. Favorite Locations Functionality

We have implemented the ability to save and manage favorite locations:

- **Backend Implementation**:
  - Added three API endpoints in `main.py`:
    - GET `/favorites` - Retrieves all saved favorite locations
    - POST `/favorites` - Adds a new favorite location
    - DELETE `/favorites/<index>` - Removes a favorite location
  - Implemented JSON file storage for persistence in the `data/favorites.json` file

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Created a new `FavoriteLocations.tsx` component with the following features:
    - Display of all saved favorite locations
    - UI for adding the current location to favorites
    - Ability to delete saved locations
    - Click functionality to quickly switch to a favorite location
  - Integrated the component into the main dashboard layout
  - Added state handling for location changes

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**:
   - Several TypeScript errors remain in the components that need to be addressed
   - Issues with component prop types need resolution

2. **Testing Setup**:
   - Backend unit tests for the weather service and favorites functionality
   - Frontend test environment configuration
   - Component tests for the new features

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Enhance backend error handling to provide more descriptive error messages
   - Improve frontend error handling to display user-friendly messages
   - Add retry mechanisms for API failures

## Getting Started

To test the new features:

1. Start the backend server:

   ```
   cd weather-dashboard/backend
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```
   cd weather-dashboard/frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at <http://localhost:3000>

## Known Issues

- TypeScript errors in some components
- Missing test environment configuration
- Some error handling improvements needed

## Next Steps

We'll focus on resolving the TypeScript errors and implementing proper testing in the next sprint.
